            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our <hi>Queſtions</hi> were, I ſuppoſe, ſent abroad in expectation of an <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Untill you receive a better from ſome other hand, you may pleaſe to make uſe of this. If it ſatisfie not, I neither challenge nor refuſe a <hi>Reply.</hi> Our Readers, I hope, will be gainers, if impartiall, whether you or I winne or loſe. Nor will I deſpaire of gaining you over to that Truth, which as yet you acknowledge not. And if my <hi>Anſwer</hi> be in part by way of <hi>Queſtions,</hi> you will not blame me, your ſelfe have led the way.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, whereas in your <hi>Title</hi> you ſay, <hi>Queſtions</hi> &amp;c. propounded to the Reverend Aſſembly, and the like afterward in your Preface: I ask, whether you do not know that the Reverend Aſſembly have no power to take notice of any Queſtions for debate and determination, unleſſe ordered ſo to do by one or both Houſes of Parliament; and therefore not till then in a capacity of returning Anſwers to ſuch Quaeres?
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158733:3"/>A friend to the Aſſembly ſhould have thought of this before he had ſpread ſuch a paper before all the world to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>Next, whether the Titles of <hi>the Reverend Aſſembly,</hi> and <hi>our Venerable Aſſembly</hi> (unleſſe put upon them in ſcorne, as they have been by others) in a buſineſſe which you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be of <hi>much difficulty,</hi> and requiring <hi>a very circumſpect handling,</hi> and upon which accordingly they have ſpent ſo much time, and laid ſo much weight upon their deſires of it, might not juſtly have kept you from publiſhing in print, under the guiſe of Queſtions, your private judgement, and (it may be) ſudden thoughts, againſt them, without ever hearing of them?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it ſeems ſtrange, that you, profeſſing ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection to be neceſſary in handling this point, ſhould yet ſo ſpeak of it, as one not ſufficiently acquainted either with the <hi>Advice</hi> of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> or Reſolutions of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> concerning it. For, in two maine things at leaſt, you quite miſtake: As firſt, you ſeem to take for granted (and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Qu.</hi> 3.) that it is deſired, the power of Suſpenſion ſhould be in a <hi>ſingle Miniſter,</hi> or in <hi>Miniſters alone,</hi> according to their <hi>private judgement:</hi> whereas the advice and deſire of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly is expreſly contrary; they place it in the <hi>whole Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> nor may they doe it but upon <hi>due proofe.</hi> Secondly, you ſeem to bend your ſtrength wholly againſt Suſpenſion before Excommunication, as granting the latter; but ſuppoſing that ſuch an antecedent Suſpenſion is the only thing ſtuck at, and unfit to be eſtabliſhed; whereas the Parliament hath already agreed on ſuch a Suſpenſion, in the caſe of ſeven ſinnes by name, which I preſume you have heard of; ſo that you have beſtowed Arguments, not only againſt the humble advice and deſires of the Aſſembly, but the Votes of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which I hope you will hereafter forbeare.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas you ſeem to load that advice of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly with many reproachfull Inſinuations, of an <hi>Arbitrary, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited, Tyrannicall, Papall domineering over the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the spirituall priviledges of Chriſtians;</hi> I deſire to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158733:3"/>know, Firſt, whether much of this was not wont to bee ſaid of the conſcientious and zealous preaching of Practicall truths, and charging ſinne upon men and women, in Books, for things in which they had a minde to be free, as <hi>Stage-playes, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, drinking Healths,</hi> and ſuch like? Secondly, why a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall power of binding Conſciences by <hi>Cenſures</hi> (purely Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, as Suſpenſion queſtionleſſe is) ſhould be more reproached for Arbitrary, &amp;c. then a generall power of <hi>binding Conſcience by preaching,</hi> wherein certainly every Miniſter hath his Commiſſion from Chriſt, without any limitation, but to keep within the bounds of the Word; and the <hi>wills of men</hi> have nothing to do to reſtrain him? Thirdly, whether it be not be true way of preventing Tyranny, not to <hi>deny</hi> the Power Chriſt hath left to his Miniſters and Elders, but to uſe it in Claſſes and Synods, in cenſuring any that exerciſe Tyranny, and if need be the Parliament may put to their help to repreſſe Tyranny in this kinde as well as in any other. Fourthly, as for <hi>Papall or Prelaticall Domineering,</hi> and <hi>claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Power as our very Lordly Prelates never durſt to claime,</hi> 1. Why, I pray, do you borrow this curteous language from the <hi>Independents,</hi> with which they moſt familiarly grace the <hi>Preſbyteriall Government?</hi> Sure you are not Independent I think, or if you were, you might have forborn this reproach, ſince in this deſire there was a full Harmony in the Aſſembly between them and the Presbyterians, as became brethren that deſired to ſee the <hi>firſt and maine Foundation</hi> of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſurely laid; which is not done till this be done which is deſired. 2. Papall or Prelaticall Domineering over Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, is power, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> engroſſed into one hand, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> to command things, and <hi rend="sup">3</hi> forbid things without Chriſts Word, or <hi rend="sup">4</hi> even againſt it; whereas there is not here the leaſt ſhadow of any ſuch thing pleaded for; but only a Power in a <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> (the Elderſhip, entruſted by Chriſt with Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) to <hi>binde the Conſciences</hi> of ſinners by <hi>Cenſures,</hi> who are firſt bound by the <hi>Word.</hi> This the Prelates did not care for further then to get money, or vex Conſciences of men; which they had power enough for by one way or other,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158733:4"/>if not full out as much Power for all ſcandals. Fifthly, If <hi>all Chriſtians may claime,</hi> as one of their ſpirituall priviledges to <hi>come to the Sacrament till they are excommunicated,</hi> or to be on no pretence <hi>kept from it if they doe deſire it;</hi> Then how ſhall the Parliament be juſtified, as <hi>not wronging Drunkards or Adulterers</hi> (and the reſt of the ſinners upon whom their Votes are already paſt) <hi>in their spirituall priviledges?</hi> I am confident they muſt either recall thoſe Votes, as not warranted by Scripture, and leave <hi>all to come when they liſt;</hi> or the ſame Scriptures that prove <hi>thoſe ſeven ſinnes</hi> to be matter of Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, will prove <hi>altogether as much</hi> as the Aſſembly ever did adviſe or deſire.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, you deſire this matter ſhould be <hi>ſetled with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moderation, certainly as little as poſſible therein left to any mans Diſcretion.</hi> Some of this you would have ſpared, I ſuppoſe, if you had ſeen the ſundry Rules which the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hath adviſed to be obſerved about this power; which they think none will deny but to ſavour of much <hi>Moderation and Caution.</hi> Withall you may remember (for ſure you know it) that in all <hi>Courts of Equity</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> (as they are called) much is, and neceſſarily muſt be left to the <hi>diſcretion of the Iudge:</hi> which is in ſome Courts with leſſe <hi>certainty,</hi> and leſſe <hi>remedy</hi> alſo (of Appeale in caſe of wrong or Tyrannie) then could be in Elderſhips, if the power deſired were ſettled in them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, you adviſe the <hi>Avoyding of Extremes,</hi> and the ſeeming <hi>Affectation of a greater Lording power over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rciences and Priviledges of Chriſtians and Brethren, then of right belongs to them.</hi> I anſwer, 1. Surely <hi>no Lording power at all</hi> over Conſciences and Priviledges of right belongs to any in the Church of Chriſt; But a <hi>Miniſteriall</hi> Power of judging and cenſuring ſcandalous ſinners belongs to Church-Officers, according to the Word; as your ſelfe cannot but grant, if you grant Excommunication at all: And if you do not grant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication at all, why do you ſo ſedulouſly bring in the mention of that in three of your Queſtions? and lay ſo much weight upon it, as you plainly do? 2. Do not you your ſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158733:4"/>know, even by experience, that no man can ſhew zeal againſt ſcandalous ſinnes but by ſome, and even too many, he will ſeem to runne into <hi>Extremes,</hi> and to affect a <hi>Lording over mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, to end theſe preparatory Animadverſions and Anſwers to your Title, Preface, and other circumſtantiall Paſſages of your Paper; you will be pleaſed ſadly and ſeriouſly to conſider, that <hi>all this reproach</hi> obliquely caſt upon the Aſſembly in the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Infinuations and others in this Paper, do in like fort <hi>asperſe all the Reformed Churches of Chriſt, that have any Eccleſiaſticall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> who all practiſe what the Aſſembly hath deſired: And yet further, diſgraces all the <hi>Diſcipline of the Primitive Church in her purest times,</hi> which was rather more ſtrict then leſſe: as hath been in part already manifeſted to the Parliament, and may be more fully, if they ſhall require it.</p>
            <p>And now I come to your four <hi>Grand Queſtions</hi> in their order, whereof the firſt is this, [<hi>Whether Matth.</hi> 18.16, 17. <hi>or</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>be meant properly of Excommunication, or Suspenſion from the Sacrament only?</hi>] I anſwer, firſt, This, under your favour, is a very impertinent Queſtion to your propounded ſcope of <hi>avoyding Arbitrary, Tyrannicall domineering over Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and Priviledges.</hi> For if they prove <hi>Excommunication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> which is a <hi>greater cenſure</hi> then Suſpenſion; then either a <hi>greater power</hi> proved by the Word, muſt be reproached with <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Arbitrary unlimitedneſſe</hi> &amp;c. or elſe that load was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly caſt upon a <hi>leſſer Power</hi> (a power of a leſſe cenſure;) for ſure you will not ſay, that it is <hi>Tyranny</hi> and an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited <hi>Domineering,</hi> to deny a Childa <hi>meales meat</hi> when it would hurt him, and none to turn him quite out of doores, whereby he may be in danger <hi>to ſtarve.</hi> So that if there be any uſe of this Queſtion in this diſpute, it ſeems to me to be only to perplex the Reader, and entangle the buſineſſe. And ſo I might diſmiſſe it.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall anſwer diſtinctly to your Texts. Firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. ſpeaks properly (as I ſuppoſe) of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as your Quaere intimates. Meane while your Gloſſe you give in a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis will not hinder it to be meant of either. For firſt, though the words are, <hi>Let him be to thee;</hi> yet this is not <hi>Excluſive</hi> (to thee and no other) but <hi>Reſpective,</hi> to thee who haſt been ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158733:5"/>And from thence the Argument will be ſtrong. 1. If <hi>to thee</hi> for reſuſing to heare the Church, then <hi>to all others</hi> who know that he hath refuſed to heare them; for that makes it as much a ſcandall to them, as before it was to thee, when thou only knewſt it. 2. Alſo <hi>binding on earth,</hi> and <hi>binding in heaven,</hi> when known by the publication of the Churches ſentence; and thy holding him thereupon as a <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Publican,</hi> will reach to make him ſo to others as well as to thee the Complainant. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, though the words be, <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee;</hi> yet neither is this excluſive, (nor yet <hi>Luke</hi> 17.) ſo as that this Rule ſhould extend only to <hi>peſonall private treſpaſſes between man and man;</hi> But contrarily, here alſo the Argument is ſtrong <hi>(à minori ad majus)</hi> If thou maiſt complaine for a <hi>private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall trespaſſe,</hi> and finally repute him a Heathen and Publican for impenitent obſtinacy, and not hearing the Church; then much more is this to be done in <hi>publike ſcandalous ſins</hi> againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: or elſe the <hi>publikeneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſcandalouſneſſe</hi> of the ſin, which are fearfull <hi>Aggravations,</hi> ſhall obtaine an Impunity and Immunity from that complaint and cenſure which belongs to a leſſer and more private offence; which is abſurd to imagine. But, ſuppoſing it to be as you contend, <hi>Let him be to thee,</hi> not <hi>to the Church;</hi> and that it is for a <hi>private treſpaſſe,</hi> not a <hi>publike ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> yet how doth this tend to prove, that the place is meant properly of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and not of <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> from the Lords Supper only?</p>
            <p>Secondly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. which ſpeak of <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to Satan,</hi> are properly meant of <hi>Excommunication;</hi> yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they deny <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> by way of endeavour to prevent the higheſt cenſure, and for the preſent preventing of miſchiefes to the Offender, and the Congregation, or thoſe that know his offence, or of the diſhonour of Chriſt, if ſuch an one (being as yet not penitent) ſhould approach his holy Table, to partake of his Body and Blood; of which he will be guilty infallibly, if he ſo come in his ſinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>With ſuch an one no not to eat,</hi> inferres Suſpenſion firſt, and after, Excommunication, upon the grounds now mentioned; and afterward to be enlarged and applyed even to this Text, and proved by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:158733:5"/>Under your former Queſtion you have another, which hath alſo two branches (and ſo we have three Queſtions in ſtead of one in this one Section, and we ſhall ſee the like afterward) You ask <hi>What warrant here is in Scripture, for Miniſters or others to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend men from the Sacrament, and not from the Congregation, and all other Ordinances with it?</hi> A. Becauſe <hi>Excommunication</hi> is the <hi>higheſt cenſure</hi> of the Church, to which men ſhould not proceed till extreme neceſſity, from the Offenders obſtinacy, compell. Mean time it may be evident, that if he ſhould be admitted, he would <hi>diſhonour Chriſt</hi> in ſtead of worſhiping him, and <hi>miſchiave his owne ſoule,</hi> in ſtead of doing it good. And therefore may fitly in this <hi>Interim</hi> be ſuſpended for the preventing thereof, till it doe appeare whether there will be a neceſſity of cutting him off by Excommunication. And againſt this none of the forementioned places, which you do annex, do make oppoſition. And among them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. will give great approbation to Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion. The one requiring, <hi>no not to eat</hi> with a Brother (at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon table) that is a Fornicator, if I can avoid it, and therfore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, not to ſuffer him to <hi>eat with me</hi> at the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> even becauſe the Church muſt endeavour to <hi>keep the Feast without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> celebrate the Supper without the mixture of ſcandalous wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons. The other commanding to <hi>with-draw from,</hi> and keep no company with a diſorderly walker, requires that he be not ſuffered to keep the Church company in their <hi>partaking</hi> of the moſt <hi>Sacred Priviledges.</hi> The Reaſon is moſt ſtrong, <hi>that he may be aſhamed;</hi> which certainly he is not like to be, ſo long as he may as freely as ever come to the Sacrament and higheſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtians. And as for <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is an example of a Leper &amp;c. this brings to minde a plaine Type of Suſpenſion; namely, <hi>the ſhutting up of a ſuſpected Leper ſeven dayes,</hi> and <hi>again ſeven dayes</hi> ſometimes, before he is a together to be <hi>ſhut out.</hi> What is this, but firſt a <hi>Tryall</hi> (and prevention of infection) by <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> before actuall and finall <hi>caſting out.</hi> And I wonder you who appeare to be read in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſhould affirme, that ſcandalous perſons were ever <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated</hi> and wholly caſt out of the Church, never barely <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred from the Sacrament;</hi> whereas it is cleare, that they had <hi>Abstenſion, &amp; abstenti,</hi> both before <hi>Excommunication;</hi> witneſſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158733:6"/>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> in diyers places: And after <hi>Excommunication,</hi> before Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the <hi>Poenitentes</hi> (as they are called) were kept ſome of them a long time, <hi>Abſtenti,</hi> from the Sacrament, and yet allowed to heare the Word among the faithfull, and even to joyne in ſome prayers though not in all.</p>
            <p>Neither do the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> deny this, however they define Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, <hi>ſc.</hi> the <hi>Major Excommunicatio,</hi> (for they had a <hi>Minor Excom.</hi> which was only Suſpenſion; and ſo ſome of our Latter Divines call Suſpenſion.) Befides, that is not greatly mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall how they determine in matters of Conſcience. As for <hi>Aretius,</hi> he apparantly defines it wrong, making it an <hi>Excluſion from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in all both ſacred and prophane or worldly matters.</hi> Whenas it cannot be denied, nor is by any but Papiſts, but in manifold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or common matters, Communion may be &amp; muſt be held by the <hi>faithfuleſt</hi> perſons with the moſt <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> even when excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the higheſt Cenſure of the Church: and ſo for ſome ſacred matters; at which even Heathens might be preſent 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23, 24. elſe how ſhould they be converted? And ſo I have done with your firſt Queſtion, and its branches and amplifications.</p>
            <p>The ſecond followes. <hi>By what divine Authority can any keep back any Chriſtian from the Sacrament, who earneſtly deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it?</hi> (This is all that is materiall in your Queſtion: although you mention a <hi>Miniſter ſingle,</hi> and his <hi>private judgement,</hi> and the perſon kept away <hi>not yet excommunicated:</hi> but to all this I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken already, and ſo ſpare tautology.) To which I anſwer, The deſire of any, whoſoever he be, or how earneſt ſoever it be, is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to ſecure him from being kept back, while the thing that he would doe will certainly be to the <hi>Diſhonour of Chriſt</hi> (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that perſon guilty of his body and blood) and to the <hi>parties owne miſchiefe,</hi> by his eating and drinking judgement and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelfe. In Conſcience, Sir, would you have a <hi>man in a frenzie</hi> not kept back, or a man <hi>extremely drunk?</hi> Yet either of them may <hi>earneſtly deſire</hi> to be admitted. I knew a woman, that in the depth of <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>deteſtable prophanneſſe,</hi> took the Bread out of her mouth and carried it home in a clout, and only toucht the Cup without drinking at all, and afterward boaſted of it, and vowed the Sacrament ſhould never come within her body, till ſhe had ſatisfaction for the wrong done her; and yet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158733:6"/>afterward, without the leaſt ſhew of Reconciliation toward the party with whom ſhe had a quarrell, or of Remorſe for her abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practice, offered to come to the Sacrament, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted for it; would you have had me to have admitted her upon thoſe teimes? If you ſay, No, then you may anſwer your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion your ſelfe by <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Give not that which is holy to dogs,</hi> (for certainly ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe a dog or ſwine in this) or by any other Text you will; and then all your Arguments to the contrary (preſently to be conſidered) fall to the ground: If you ſay, Yes, you ſhall give me leave to ſay, you ſhall be no Caſuiſt in this to ſatisfie my conſcience: And yet I beleeve you walk by rules of Conſcience in other matters; only I know not how you ſwarve in this great Queſtion.</p>
            <p>But you ſay <hi>We read of no circumciſed perſon that was ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard from the Paſſeever by the Prieſts, that was willing or deſirous to eat it.</hi> Anſ. Sure you have forgotten (for you have certainly read it) <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. a caſe of perſons unclean, deſirous to Receive, and yet kept back, and a <hi>Rule</hi> made upon it for time to come, that ſuch <hi>ſhould be kept back.</hi> And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. Officers ſet by that Godly Reformer <hi>Jehojadah</hi> the high Prieſt, to keep away the Uncleane from the Temple. And if you ſay, This was only for <hi>Legall</hi> not <hi>Morall</hi> uncleanneſſe; I would for the preſent ask you, <hi>whether this were not written for our learning</hi> (and imitation) and what this <hi>Typicall</hi> Law did ſignifie, but out contended for <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion.</hi> And as for thoſe 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. admitted, though <hi>not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified after the purification of the Sanctuary.</hi> If the Prieſt <hi>knew</hi> any to be unclean, you dare not (I think) ſay, but that they <hi>ſinned in admitting them,</hi> contrary to the forementioned expreſſe Law. And God ſhewed ſome <hi>ſigne of diſpleaſure,</hi> till upon <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiahs</hi> prayer he healed them.</p>
            <p>Next you ſay, <hi>Chriſt himſelfe admitted Judas to it, though he knew him to be a Devill and a Traytor.</hi> I grant it (and that <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. proves it, though many argue the contrary from the other Evangeliſts,) But Chriſt had not <hi>convicted Iudas</hi> to be ſuch an one (nor yet named him to any, till by the Sop he inſinuated him to <hi>Iohn</hi>) which wholly alters the caſe: For the Aſſembly would not have any man kept away by the Miniſter upon his <hi>owne private knowledge</hi> (though never ſo certaine) but upon <hi>juſt proofe and conviction</hi> before the Elderſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:158733:7"/>But you adde, that <hi>Paul uſurped no other authority to himſelfe, nor gave authority to others to keep unworthy Receivers from the Sacrament, but only admoniſhed them &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer: Sure <hi>Paul</hi> never <hi>uſurped</hi> any authority at all, neither this nor any other; but his delivering the Inceſtuous Corinthian, alſo <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> to Satan, was at leaſt a <hi>keeping them from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whatever it was more. For I cannot beleeve your ſelfe can think, that a man while ſo in the <hi>Devils poſſeſſion</hi> may be admitted to the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> to partake of the pledges of his Body and Blood. And for <hi>giving power to others,</hi> he doth it not in ſyllables in that Chapter; But in <hi>declaring openly,</hi> ſuch as are openly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Receivers, to be ſuch Offenders againſt Chriſt, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to themſelves in the very Act of Receiving; he muſt needs <hi>imply</hi> that thoſe who are to <hi>judge thoſe that are within</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.) ought to keep ſuch away from adding ſinne to ſinne, and miſchiefe to miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>Therefore your ſubordinare Queſtion <hi>(Whether a Miniſter by admonition and dehortation hath not diſcharged his full duty and conſcience)</hi> is ſoone anſwered. In a <hi>Doctrinall way,</hi> as a Preacher to him, he hath; but not, as he is one to whom, with the reſt of the Elderſhip, the <hi>Rule and Care of the Church of God is committed</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. unleſſe he have, what in him lies, <hi>judged</hi> (according to prooſe) and <hi>cenſured</hi> a ſcandalous Offender, and ſo kept him from the Sacrament; which, I take it, S. <hi>Paul</hi> threatens to doe to ſuch Impenitents as he ſhould finde when he next came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and Chap. 13. And your cited Text of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſaith nothing to the contrary. For <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20. they are ſpoken only of the Duty of <hi>Preaching,</hi> that a Prophet or Preacher, <hi>in reference to that duty,</hi> hath delivered his ſoule when he hath given <hi>warning:</hi> But ſo farre as he hath a <hi>further power,</hi> he is not quit, if he uſe it not. Witneſſe <hi>Elyrs</hi> ſinne and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who yet gave his ſonnes as <hi>grave and ſerious a warning</hi> as could be, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. but becauſe being a Judge he <hi>reſtrained</hi> them not, by cenſures ſutable to their ſcandals, God charged guilt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily upon him and all his Family.</p>
            <p>But I wonder much (I ſay not <hi>quâ fide,</hi> but <hi>quâ curâ</hi>) you ſay the <hi>Lyturgies of our owne and the French Churches in their Exhortations before the Sacrament, both intimate and reſolve</hi> what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158733:7"/>you affirme; that a Miniſter hath <hi>diſcharged his full duty and conſcience by admonition and dehortation.</hi> When firſt, you know that in expreſſe words in the Rubrick before the Sacrament in our late Book of Common prayer, the Curate (a ſingle Miniſter) is expreſly charged, <hi>not to admit</hi> an obſtinate uncharitable perſon And ſecondly, all the world knowes (or may know) that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, charges Miniſters with the reſt of the Elderſhip, to <hi>ſuſpend all ſcandalous perſons from the Sacrament when proved ſo before them.</hi> And accordingly they doe ſo in all the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> and all others of that Nation in <hi>Holland</hi> or elſewhere: And <hi>ſo have done in England over ſince K. Edward the ſixth time</hi> (except in Q. <hi>Maries</hi>) <hi>by the allowance of our Princes.</hi> As for the <hi>Exhortations before the Sacrament,</hi> they ſerve to warne thoſe whoſe ſinnes are <hi>ſecret and not proved,</hi> and not to ſtand for <hi>all Diſcipline</hi> toward thoſe that are notoriouſly ſcandalous. I adde, if it were meant to be the <hi>only</hi> barre of open ſcandals, it would be ridiculous to ſuch as knew themſelves to be ſuch, and knew that others knew it alſo, to ſay, <hi>If any of you be a Blaſphemer, or an Adulterer &amp;c. bewaile your ſinnes, and come not to this holy Table &amp;c.</hi> as it was in our Lyturgy: Or much more to ſay, <hi>I excommunicate ſuch and ſuch</hi> (as in the French Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy) and yet I ſee them and know them, and ſo doth all the Congregation, and let them communicate notwithſtanding. The very <hi>Pagans</hi> were never ſo careleſſe of their <hi>Sacra,</hi> as to let thoſe they counted prophane, to partake in them. If <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould, will not they riſe up in judgement againſt us?</p>
            <p>Your third Queſtion is, <hi>Whether unprofitable and unworthy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word be not as great, as dangerous, as damning a ſinne, as the unworthy Receiving of the Sacrament?</hi> Whereunto you adde diverſe Texts <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. and 3.7, 8, 12. and 6.6, 7, 8. and (after) two ſubordinate Queſtions in the ſame Paragraph. I anſwer to them all. Firſt, to your maine Queſtion I ſay, That every <hi>ſingle Act</hi> of unprofitable and unworthy hearing of the Word, is not ſo great, ſo dangerous, ſo damning a ſinne, as <hi>unworthy Receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> Becauſe 1. thoſe ſinnes are greateſt upon which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God puts the greateſt weight; But the Spirit of God puts no where ſuch weight upon a <hi>ſingle Act</hi> of unprofitable hearing.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158733:8"/>For all your Texts, every one of them, ſpeak only of <hi>habituall and cuſtomary,</hi> and ſome of them only of <hi>finall</hi> unprofitable hearing. But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 27, 29. ſpeaks of <hi>every ſingle act</hi> of Receiving the Lords Supper unworthily. 2. Againe, whoever receives the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament unworthily, hath firſt received the Word unworthily (and that, it may be, not once, but many times) and ſo hath added a further ſinne to it. But a man may receive the Word unworthily, who receives not the Sacrament at all, and ſo ſins but a ſingle ſin; whereas the unworthy Receiver of the Sacrament ſins certainly double. 3. Moreover the matter preached oftentimes, is but a <hi>Particular of leſſer conſequence,</hi> and ſo the ſin leſſe to receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily: But the matter of the Sacrament is the higheſt of all Chriſtianity, and therefore the ſin is the greater to receive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily. 4. Further, ſuppoſe the Sermon was of the <hi>Grace of Chriſt,</hi> and the benefit of his Body and Blood; yet is it a greater fin to receive the Sacrament unworthily, becauſe in that is a <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtation of Gods love,</hi> and Chriſts Grace, a ſeale to the Word. Therefore to deſpiſe it, and receive it unworthily, is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtation of obſtinate impenitency unbeliefe, and ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Grace of Chriſt, and the Love of God. 5 Once more, The Receiver of the Sacrament doth <hi>more ſolemnly pretend faith</hi> in Chriſt, and owning him as his Lord, then the hearer of the Word: he ſeales outwardly to God and Chriſt, as well as receives outward ſeales; which the Hearer doth not by the act of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (for a Heathen may come in to heare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) Therefore he ſins a greater, more dangerous, more damning ſinne, then any man that this or that time, receives the Word unprofitably and unworthily.</p>
            <p>Next, if you would compare a <hi>customary</hi> unworthy hearing, with a <hi>ſingle act</hi> of unworthy Receiving, and ask whether it bee not as great a ſinne, &amp;c. To this I ſhall anſwer, by conſidering your two ſubordinate Queſtions, which are, 1 <hi>Whether Miniſters upon ſome pretence may not as well keep the people from preaching, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to preach to them, &amp;c?</hi> And 2 <hi>What ſubſtantiall difference they can produce warranted by Scripture, why they may not deny the Word as well as the Sacrament?</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, there is an expreſſe charge to <hi>preach the Gospell to every creature,</hi> that is, even to Pagans and Infidels while remayning ſuch: you will not ſay, there is the like
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:158733:8"/>for giving the Sacrament, while ſuch. Secondly, there is a like Charge of <hi>inſtructing in meekneſſe thoſe that oppoſe themſelves,</hi> which will hold, I beleeve, even to profeſſed Chriſtians, for they are but too often <hi>oppoſers,</hi> and you will not ſay but ſuch muſt ſtill be inſtructed, <hi>if at any time God will give them repentance, &amp;c.</hi> But there is no ſuch charge to adminiſter the Sacrament to oppoſers or impenitents. 3 That which gives a warrant not to baptize a man (though pretending to deſire it) will, from the parity of the nature of both the Sacraments, give warrant to <hi>deny him the Lords Supper.</hi> Had <hi>Philip</hi> manifeſtly ſeen <hi>Act.</hi> 8. that which <hi>Peter</hi> did afterward, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was <hi>in the gall of bitterneſſe and bond of iniquity;</hi> doubtleſſe he would not have baptized him, though he ſhould have offered himſelfe. An ignorant man, or a prophane man is to be <hi>preached to,</hi> but not to be <hi>baptized,</hi> till he have gotten knowledge and expreſſed repentance: Therfore by the ſame reaſon, one equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant or prophane (though baptized) is not to be admitted to the Lords Supper: and if you would ſay, yes, his <hi>baptiſm gives him right,</hi> and nothing can after deprive him of it; I pray, would not this furniſh the Anabaptiſts with a moſt forcible argument againſt baptizing of infants? That ſuch baptizing them makes parents and others careleſſe of their education, and themſelves of their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our when grown up? And I remember this was once urged to me. To which no rationall anſwer that I know can be given, if upon this baptiſm they may chalenge the Lords Supper at ſuch an age, how <hi>ignorant</hi> ſoever they remain, and how <hi>ſcandalous</hi> ſoever they grow. Were not this the way to make all that are zealous of Chriſts honour and the good of ſoules, to abhorre ſuch baptiſm as hardening parents and children both in impiety and contempt of God? I pray conſider it. 4 But I adde, <hi>the word is the proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to convert men,</hi> which therefore muſt be preached even to pagans and oppoſers (till they grow altogether deſperate.) But the Lords Supper is a <hi>Seal for confirmation</hi> of thoſe that are or ſeem to be <hi>beleevers and penitents.</hi> If therefore any relapſe into ſinne and remain impenitent, the Word is the proper meanes ſtill to be offerd to him for his recovery, which muſt be ſpoken as to an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but the Sacrament is to be denied him (and that deniall is alſo a concurrent meanes of this recovery, as proclaiming him to his conſcience unworthy of it, and ſo to others, if the Suſpenſion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158733:9"/>be publiſht, as it muſt ſometimes be publiſht to all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not alwaies,) and that becauſe it cannot be given but as an <hi>actuall Seal of Gods forgiveneſſe,</hi> which for the preſent he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to be uncapable of. 5 Finally, the <hi>Word</hi> hath a power (often manifeſted) to <hi>conquer obſtinate ſinners,</hi> and there are many promiſes of it, though the diſpenſation of this power be not at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon, or to every perſon, but when and to whom God pleaſes: But there is no ſuch power mentioned in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the Sacrament; it is for living men (and ſuch as are not in a ſwoon neither, but ſomewhat lively and hungty) to feed upon that banquet; not to be put into dead mens mouths or hands, or thoſe whoſe mouthes (that is, their hearts) appeare to be ſhut againſt it: But the word preached hath rayſed dead ſoules, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, millions, (according to the propheſie and promiſe <hi>John</hi> 5) even all that ever come to life in an ordinary way. Here is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence enough to fatisfy both your Queſtions. And for your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments added to the firſt of them, I anſwer briefly, firſt a Miniſter is no way partaker of any ones <hi>unprofitable hearing,</hi> or guilty of his damnation, being <hi>commanded to preach to him</hi> for his good; as it may be, how ill ſoever he be when he begins to preach to him: But he, and the Elderſhip, are partakers of the ſin of the <hi>unworthy Communicant,</hi> if they admit him, of whom they have ſuch proofe that they know he will be guilty of Chriſts body and blood, and will eat and drink damnation to himſelfe; for they are no where commanded to admit ſuch to the Sacrament; but forbidden by the nature of the Ordinance, and his apparant unworthineſſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (beſide the places forementioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.) Secondly a Miniſter is not <hi>to give holy things to dogs,</hi> &amp;c. This is generall, and not confined to the <hi>Word</hi> only. Your ſelfe only ſay, <hi>It is principally meant of the Word;</hi> and ſure it hath a <hi>Truth</hi> even relating to the Sacraments; for they alſo are <hi>holy things,</hi> and <hi>pearles,</hi> and ſo are not to be caſt to ſuch as will <hi>trample and deſpiſe them.</hi> And though it is true, that ſometimes there may be ſuch a <hi>Deſperate oppoſition againſt Preaching,</hi> as that this ſentence will forbid a man to <hi>preach any longer</hi> to ſuch: As your Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 51. doe indeed prove. (But <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. hath nothing at all to that purpoſe but only ſpeaks of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of obſtinate unbeleevers,) yet this is rare. And in this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:158733:9"/>caſe I will grant, ſuch are not to be preaent to, but kept away what one can; but no others are ſo in regard of the word. But a man that is infallibly and groſly <hi>ignorant</hi> of the principles of Religion; or notoriouſly <hi>ſcandalous</hi> and impenitent in it, is to this Ordinance of the Sacrament, a <hi>dog</hi> or a <hi>ſwine,</hi> as certainly diſhonouring Chriſt and miſchieving his own ſoul, if he communicate; as a Pagan (who hath nothing to do with Chriſt;) and therefore ſuch a <hi>holy thing</hi> ſuch a <hi>pearl</hi> is not to be given or caſt to ſuch. 3 Though the word profit not where faith is wanting, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2 yet this is not meant where faith is not already; for then it ſhould profit none ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, all being without faith till by preaching, the Spirit of God work it in them; and therfore it is to be preacht to men that want faith, that they may want it no longer: but ignorant perſons have certainly no faith, and impenitents have either none or uſe none while impenitents, and ſo cannot profit by the Sacrament, becauſe they cannot ſeed upon Chriſt, and therefore may not be admitted to the Sacramentall eating of the Bread and Wine to the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſt, and further undoing their own ſoules. 4 Finally, though the word unprofitably heard, (that is, <hi>finally,</hi> to the end of a mans life) encreaſes and aggravates his ſinnes and becomes the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death to death, to ſuch unworthy receivers of it; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the Apoſtle told us, there is ſtill a <hi>peradventure</hi> that God may give even to thoſe that oppoſe themſelves now, repentance hereafter, and accordingly he therefore charges ſtill to <hi>inſtruct in meekneſſe</hi> even ſuch; till they come to be open and obſtinate blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, they muſt be preacht to: But no ſuch hopes being given nor charge towards unworthy receivers of the Sacrament: Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Elders muſt refuſe them till they appear to be of a better minde. And this leads to your fourth Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Which is (ſummarily) <hi>Whether ſuch may bee denied the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who profeſſe ſincere repentance, and promiſe newneſſe of life?</hi> (here again you interpoſe <hi>not being excommanicated,</hi> and if he <hi>deſire to receive,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters private opinion;</hi> to all which it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to ſpeak again, having done it ſufficiently already:) To which you premiſe fundry Arguments to prove the negative; and ſome follow to refell the affirmative. I will firſt anſwer your Queſtion, then conſider your Arguments on both hands. To your Queſtion then <hi>I</hi> ſay 1. if he <hi>profeſſe his ſincere repentance, &amp;c.</hi> in ſuch a manner
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:158733:10"/>as according to the Rules of Chriſt the Miniſter and Elders, and thoſe that know the ſcandall are bound to beleeve that he doth <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely repent;</hi> none ought to keep him back, and if he were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, he ought to be abſolv'd, and received again into the Church without delay, as ſoon as ſuch repentance appeares. 2 But if you mean his <hi>bare ſaying ſo much</hi> without further ſign of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or only ſuch ſign as according to the nature of the crime; no rationall man can ſay it is a ſufficient proof of repentance; the caſe is otherwiſe foradultery, or inceſt, or blaſphemy, there muſt ſurely be ſuch a ſenſe of the ſinne manifeſted, ſuch a taking heed of the occaſions, and the like, as may make it probable that he intends to keep his promiſe of a <hi>new life:</hi> or elſe it will be a meer mockery for any one to be called before the Elderſhip for any ſcandall; for a word ſhall excuſe and acquit them, although perhaps before they came thither, they told their companions, that they meant not to keep any ſuch promiſe; and if this be told to the Elderſhip, yet they muſt take his ſingle and bare word that he is ſorry for thoſe ſpeeches as well as for his other fault; and ſo it muſt be twenty times one after another: Which, I ſay, were to turn all Church Diſcipline into a Ridiculous Folly, and a hardning of ſinners rather then doing any good upon them.</p>
            <p>Yet for this you ſeem to argue with many reaſons. 1 <hi>God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone knowes the heart, and who are his.</hi>] Anſ. They are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures words, but miſapplyed in this caſe. 1 <hi>Chron</hi> 6.30. ſpeaks of a mans <hi>ſecret prayers to God,</hi> not of proving or approving Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards men. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.19. ſpeaks of <hi>Gods knowing his elect,</hi> and not at all that men are not to judge of mens repentance; rather the next words plead for this <hi>[let every one that names the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity]</hi> implying that he who doth not ſo in his behaviour, cannot be owned <hi>among men,</hi> among Chriſtians, as belonging to Chriſt, whatever he may be in <hi>Gods ſecret Decree.</hi> This then confirmes the Elderſhips power of judgeing <hi>by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting or not departing from iniquity,</hi> and not <hi>by bare and ſleight words only.</hi> Would you in the forementioned caſe of the wicked woman, have taken a few words as a ſufficient proof of repentance, without great proof of ſorrow, and deteſtation of her ſelfe for ſo horrid a wickedneſſe? 2 You ſay, <hi>Miniſters know not the heart, nor who are Gods, but may oft deem thoſe worthy communicants who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:158733:10"/>are not, (as cloſe hypocrites, &amp;c.) and thoſe unworthy which are not,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5. <hi>to</hi> 14. Anſ. You ſeem not to be afraid of <hi>judgeing thoſe worthy that are not;</hi> when ſo ſleight a matter as a <hi>profeſſion of repentance,</hi> without mention of any fignes, muſt ſuffice to count them worthy, becauſe <hi>God knowes the heart, not Miniſters.</hi> But Miniſters and Elders are to judge as the Apoſtle directs <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. Somemens ſinnes are manifeſt before-hand, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to judgement (and ſo their good) and ſome follow after that is, according to apparant proofe offering it ſelfe, or diſcovered by time, or enquiry, ſo the judgement ought to be. <hi>Samuels</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not by any words or ſhewes of good but by a <hi>bodily comelineſſe,</hi> and it was a peculiar Office; that hinders not but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Elders may judge by mens lives, whether they be worthy of the ordinary priviledges of Chriſtians. They are blameleſſe if they admit only cloſe hypocrites, becauſe God only can judge of them. But men may judge competently of mens <hi>be haviours,</hi> elſe why ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. and that known Text. <hi>By their fruiis you ſhall know them;</hi> and if they judge by proof and tokens, and fruits of repentance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word, they will hardly judge any unworthy who are not, though this be the great Fear alledged againſt them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You ſay, <hi>God can fuddenly change the heart in a moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Miniſter can take notice of it, Act.</hi> 9.3. to 28.] A. God can, but what is this to your purpoſe? By this Argument, there needs not Judges, with the Elders, of thoſe that are within, then ſurely they muſt goe according to ſufficient <hi>outward expreſſions,</hi> and not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God hath turned any ones heart, before others can take notice of it. And your Inſtance of <hi>Sauls (Pauls)</hi> converſion clears it. Indeed there were no Miniſters by, when he was ſtruck down; But when Chriſt ſent <hi>Ananias</hi> to him after a ſecond charge to goe, he was faine to avouch him a choſen Veſſell; and after that the Church at Jeruſalem durſt not own him, till <hi>Barnabas</hi> brought him to the Apoſtles, and bare witneſſe that he had preacht Chriſt at <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> And when ſinners expreſſe any ſigne of Repentance like this (though they were converted before any took notice of it) blame them that refuſe them. But in the meane time, I pray. give leave to Miniſters, the <hi>Stewards of Chriſts Myſteries</hi> (of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:158733:11"/>whom it is <hi>required that they be found faithfull</hi>) that they be ſo jealous over Chriſtians with a godly jealouſie, and ſo zealous for Chriſts honour (the honour of his Death ſhewed forth in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament) as not to beleeve or judge them worthy, who have ſhewed themſelves unworthy, upon <hi>a poſſibility that God can turn their hearts in an inſtant;</hi> which is ſo farre from a <hi>Godly jealouſie</hi> or zeale, that there cannot lightly be a greater <hi>Careleſneſſe</hi> or <hi>Lukewarmneſſe</hi> imaginable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You ſay, [<hi>We muſt not cenſoriouſly judge one another, becauſe we ſtand or fall to our own Maſter, Mat.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. <hi>to</hi> 15.] It is true, but very impertinently alledged: Your Texts <hi>Mat.</hi> 7 and <hi>Luk</hi> 6. forbid only private judging, without or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond juſt cauſe, as to judge a man ill who ſeems good; or judge ill, when it is as poſſible he meant well as ill; or to judge a man a wicked unregenerate for a particular failing, or a man to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate becauſe he yet ſhewes no repentance, and the like; it is ſuch judging as this that is forbidden, not all judging, unleſſe you will make void (as I am ſure you will not) all <hi>Civill Iudicature,</hi> as well as all Eccleſiaſticall. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. ſpeaks only of judging men as unconſcionable, or not ſound Chriſtians, for forbearing or uſing Chriſtian Liberty about dayes and meats and ſuch like; not at all of judging men in an Eccleſiaſticall Iudicatory (no more then Civill) for open ſcandals and impenitency: which alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the words next after thoſe you name, <hi>yea he ſhall be holden up,</hi> which you will not, I think, affirme offcandalous ſinners. God hath not promiſed to uphold or recover ſuch, as he hath to uphold weak ſcrupulous Conſciences, that do (or do not) things to him, and not to themſelves: Therefore all the ſtrength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies in the word <hi>Cenſorious,</hi> which I deny can be truly urged againſt the Elderſhips cenſuring ſcandals upon proofe, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving without ſufficient proofe of Repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You goe on (and ſo doe I) [<hi>None muſt quench the ſmoaking flax, or break the bruiſed Reed; nor diſcourage weak Chriſtians by overmuch rigor or indiſcretion, Mat.</hi> 12.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.] Anſw. Very good But will you ſay, that every one that barely ſaith, he doth ſincerely repent, and promiſes to lead a new life, is a bruiſed Reed, or ſmoaking flax? or that to require a rationall proofe of Repentance for an undeniable ſcandall (perhaps very groſſe) is to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:158733:11"/>diſcourage weak Chriſtians by overmuch rigour and indiſcretion? You will remember (I am ſure Miniſters and Elders muſt) that of <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>He that juſtifiet the wicked, and he that condemnes the juſt, even they both are an abomination to the Lord;</hi> the one as well as the other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But you adde <hi>[Every Communicant is bound to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which he beſt knowes (not others peremptorily to examine him)</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4, 5.] I anſwer. Firſt, a mans being bound to examine himſelfe is no Excluſive in ſuch matters as fall within the cogniſance of other men; But it is a precept to every man for his Conſcience within, after all the examination and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others. Secondly, withall it is not univerſally true, <hi>That a man is beſt known to himſelfe.</hi> For the Apoſtle ſaith of ſome, that <hi>they meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among themſelves, are not wiſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks to the ſame purpoſe more then once; <hi>The rich man is wiſe in his owne conceit, but his neighbour comes and ſearches him, Prov.</hi> 28.11. <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their owne eyes, and yet are not clenſed from their filthineſſe, Prov.</hi> 30.12. And there is nothing more certaine among men, then that many wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, think they have ſufficiently repented, and have faith in Chriſt and love to God, when the contrary to all this is more then appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Thirdly, are there not Duties, which even private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, much more Miniſters (and Elderſhips) ſtand obliged unto towards wicked men, and impenitent ſinners? And if ſo, then certainly they may <hi>peremptorily</hi> (that is confidently and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly) judge ſuch, and accordingly examine them in ſuch caſes as they may meddle in; and your other cited Texts ſay not a ſyllable to the contrary: For, as for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. S. <hi>Panl</hi> expreſly in that chapter, and the ſoregoing threatens to cenſure (even ſharply) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among the Corinthians; which queſtionleſſe he never meant without ſtrict (and if you liſt to call it ſo, <hi>poremptory</hi>) examination And ſaith he, not clearly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1 <hi>In the mouth of two or three witneſſes every wordſhall be eſtabliſhed?</hi> Even while he is ſpeaking of <hi>his not ſparing them</hi> when he came again?

               </gap> upon v. 4. and For how can I (or any) <hi>reſtore with the spirit of meekneſſe one that is fallen through infirmity</hi> if I may not peremptorily examine his fact and

If I meddle at all with him being fallen, I may call that an <hi>Infirmity,</hi> which is an <hi>Enormity,</hi> if I examine him not, and others too perhaps about him: I may ſpeak peace, when God ſpeaks none. And I pray, if I give the Sacrament to one whom by all Rules of the Word I cannot but judge impenitent, doe not I really <hi>preach Pcace,</hi> when God ſaith <hi>there is no peace</hi> to him? And offer him that as an actuall ſeal that he is forgiven, when God declares to me in his Word, that ſuch a man is not forgiven, while he ſo goes on in his ſinne, as in not forgiving another, or the like?</p>
            <p n="7">7. What you adde, [<hi>That every One is to beare his own ſinne, not anothers, in which he is no partaker, Gal.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Exek.</hi> 33.1, <hi>to</hi> 20. <hi>Ezek</hi> 18.4. <hi>to</hi> 21.] advances your Cauſe nothing. For how can a Miniſter avoide being <hi>partaker of anothers ſinne,</hi> which is notoriouſly ſcandalous, if hee (with the Elderſhip) uſe not the Power which God hath given them, <hi>(to edification and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction)</hi> to cenſure thoſe that refuſe to repent, as unworthy to partake of the Seale of forgiveneſſe, and thoſe that ſo abuſe the grace of Chriſt as viſibly to continue in ſinne, as unworthy to partake of the viſible Pledges of that Grace of his? To <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. I have anſwered already; and your ſelfe anſwers the Texts in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> by putting in <hi>[in which he is no partaker.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. But you have one thing more, [<hi>Every Christian when he is invited to the Sacrament, is bound under paine of ſinne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to receive it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.] I anſwer: If you mean, That <hi>though he be, and reſolve to be impenitent,</hi> he is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; how ſaid you above. That a Miniſters duty is <hi>ſeriouſly to dehort</hi> ſuch as he deemes unworthy, not to receive till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fit to participate, under paine of eating and drinking their own damnation and other judgements that will follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it a Miniſters duty to <hi>dehort</hi> a man from his Duty, and to threaten with damnation, other and judgements to forbeare, when he is bound under paine of ſin and contempt to receive? If you ſay, No, he is not bound to receive being impenitent, but rather bound not to receive till he becomes more fit: But that he is bound to repent (to examine himſelf, that he may repent) and then to come under paines, &amp;c. I ſay ſo too. And from thence inferre, That the Miniſters and Elders, who are by Chriſt made Governours in his Church to judge thoſe that are within, are to keepe him that is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:158733:12"/>apparantly unworthy and manifeſts not repentance, from eating and drinking his own damnation, when they ſee he offers to doe it: And when they ſee him penitent, they are to urge him to come to receive the Seale of his Pardon, under paine of ſinne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if they ſee him backward to it, or doubtfull about it. As for your Texts, that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. hath often been ſpoken to; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. is very ſtrangely cited to your ſcope; for I beſeech you, is the <hi>not receiving the Sacrament,</hi> (even when a man voluntarily neglects it, through ſome ſinfull diſtemper) <hi>a treading under foot the Sonne of God? or counting the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing? or a doing despite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> (which are the Apoſtles phraſes there:) Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not <hi>unworthy receiving,</hi> which is expreſſely ſaid to be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>guilty of Chriſts body and blood,</hi> nearer to that horrid wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he ſpeaks of? Though I am farre from ſaying, that every unworthy Communicant is guilty of ſuch prodigious impiety. But I ask againe, which of the two in the Scripture language and account comes the nearer to it? If the place had any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſpeciall to the Sacrament, I ſhould not doubt to ſay, but the <hi>ſcandalous Communicant</hi> were much ſooner meant, then even the <hi>prophane forbearer.</hi> And thus I have anſwered your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which lead in your Queſtion, and whereby you would prove the Negative: and withall part of your refutation of the Affirmative. The reſt I ſhall diſpatch briefly.</p>
            <p n="9">9. You ſay, <hi>[He eats and drinks damnation to himſelfe, not to the Minister or the other Communicants;]</hi> Anſ. Not to the Miniſter or other Communicants: Firſt, If his ſinne be unknown: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If his ſinne be unproved: Thirdly, If hee make ſuch ſhew of repentance (though God knowes it to be counterfeit) that by the rules of the Word, he is to be judged penitent: Fourthly, If the other Communicants have done their duties to bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or have him kept back: Fiſthly, If the Miniſter doe what lies in him to keep him back, by judging him for his part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to juſt prooſe. But <hi>to the Miniſter alſo</hi> (and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants in their degree) if he willingly conſent to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, by reſuſing or forbearing to uſe his part of power Chriſt hath entruſted him with, to keep unworthy ones back; and if the Communicants help not the Miniſter in a fitting manner to debarre them.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:158733:13"/>10. This is not diſproved by your ſaying, <hi>[he ſhall only beare his own burthen, and give an account of himſelfe to God, Gal.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12.] For the Word <hi>[only]</hi> is your addition to the Text of <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. And no other Text in Scripture, I ſpeak it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily, hath any ſuch excluſive as to diſcharge other men from doing their duties to reclaime impenitents, by ſhaming them, and hindring them from that which would harden them in their ſinnes. Neither is the Word, <hi>only,</hi> in the Text, or ſence of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. relating to undeniable ſinnes, or open proofe of repentance or impenitence but only to his inward conſcienciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in uſing or forbearing Chriſtian Liberty about meats and dayes (as was toucht before) of that a man only ſhall give account for himſelfe to God and not for another: But in open matters, I am ſure there were that had the <hi>rule over</hi> Chriſtians, ſome that <hi>Watch for their ſouls as thoſe that muſt give an account, Heb.</hi> 13.17. And thoſe, I ſuppoſe, were the Miniſters and Elders: And the Word hath not taken that office from them ſince.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And whereas you ſay. <hi>[The Adminiſtration is only the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Act, which is a holy and Divine Inſtitution, the unworthy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation the Parties own iniquity,]</hi> I anſwer, firſt, that there is no ſuch Inſtitution that a Miniſter muſt adminiſter it to all baptized perſons that offer to come, and promiſe to leade a new life. Shew me ſuch an Inſtitution, and I yeeld you the whole cauſe: But this <hi>I am certaine you can never doe</hi> (to returne you your own words above) neither expreſſely nor by any Scripture-conſequence. For if ſo, then no man may be at all Excommunicated, or kept from the Sacrament, by any power left to any on earth; Which yet you have not offered to aſſert, what ever your Arguments have ſeemed to inſinuate. As for the Parallel of <hi>unworthy communicating</hi> with <hi>unworthy hearing,</hi> I have already ſpoken I ſuppoſe, enough to it: and ſo ſhall not multiply more words about it at this time.</p>
            <p>I have done with your <hi>Queſtions.</hi> But have ſomething to ſay to your <hi>Concluſion,</hi> wherein your confidence and language riſes high, and you lay load enough upon that ſort of men, <hi>Who have not yet put off their propheſying in Sack-cloth,</hi> What ever others have done. In your Title and Preface, the Aſſembly is ſtiled by you, <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Venerable:</hi> But now (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelfe, that hee was <hi>as unknown and yet well known</hi>) they are to you, only, <hi>ſome men
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:158733:13"/>that pretend to ſuch a large unlimited Eccleſiasticall power,</hi> as you <hi>cannot diſcern any ſhaddow of reaſon, why any godly Miniſter ſhould ever earneſtly contend for it; much leſſe, that any of them ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to give over their Miniſter, to which Chriſt hath called them unleſſe they can obtain ſuch a power from the Parliament as neither Chriſt nor his Apostles, nor the Primitive Chriſtians in the pureſt times did ever exerciſe.</hi> For are you, or can you be Ignorant that in all this you ſtrike at the Aſſembly, the whole body? who as an Aſſembly have preſented their humble Advices and deſires to the Honourable Houſes; and no other perſons (that I know of) have formally appeared about the largeneſſe and unlimitedneſſe of the power to keep perſons ſcandalous, or ignorant, from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Aſſembly only And they only, (of which I ſhall now give the World ſome account, ſince you have made ſo publike a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of it,) tendring their humble deſires in a late petition, were the men that expreſſed their ſad ſtraight (in caſe &amp;c.) and humble reſolution accordingly. Vnhappy men, (ſure) that contend ſo long, ſo over earneſtly, with ſuch an unfitting reſolution for that which you cannot <hi>ſee any ſhaddow of reaſon for,</hi> and which <hi>Christ nor his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, nor the Primitive Church in the pureſt times, did ever exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe?</hi> But I ſuppoſe that all men are not of your mind, and that ſome of our Readers, that were ſo partly heretofore, have by this time ſeene ſomewhat more then a <hi>ſhadow of reaſon</hi> for what the Aſſembly hath deſired, and I have now pleaded. And that though Chriſt did not in perſon exerciſe any power of Suſpenſion or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication at all, nor the Apoſtles frequently that we read of: Yet both Chriſt and his Apoſtles have given ſo faire grounds and directions for as much as is deſired in either kinde of cenſure and that the records of the Primitive Church in the pureſt times ſpeak ſo probably for the exerciſe of it in thoſe dayes, as that they will rather wonder <hi>at your confident oppoſition,</hi> ſpecially in ſuch a ſeaſon as this, then <hi>at their deſires or reſolution.</hi> Which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was not by them rudely taken up or affectedly expreſt; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nature of the buſineſſe in hand, and the preſſure upon their conſciences to diſcharge their duties in ſpeaking out the full truth before it were too late. They had before their eyes how extreamly Chriſt is diſhonoured, by thoſe that pretend to honour him; how deſperately ſuch wound and deſtroy their ſoules, with that which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:158733:14"/>they pretend and expect to receive for their eterhall good: That this being generall throughout the Nation, and no ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt it, muſt needs be a Nationall ſinne, bringing and continuing Nationall judgements: That God hath brought the Nation, (that part among whom we are) into a ſolemn and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Covenant <hi>of Reformation according to the Word of God and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches, and to endeavour by all weanes the reoting out of prophanneſſe and whatſoever is contrary to the power of godlineſſe.</hi> To effect this, they ſaw no way appointed by God nor poſſible in reaſon, if the Eccleſiaſticall Power of thoſe whom Chriſt hath fet in his Church to govern it, be limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo, as that ſeandalous perſons of all ſorts cannot be kept away. From all which they concluded, that to ſit down under a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Reformation, as contented with it (now ſpecially when Gods Iudgements ſtill ſhew he is in no wife contented with what wee have yet done,) would be to betray the Cauſe of God, &amp; the hopes of all the People of God, that have groaned and wept ſo long for a through Reformation, and ſpecially in this particular: and withall to expoſe many thouſands of ſoules to the danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn away to ſchiſme and hereſie (alſo Covenanted againſt:) The Fautors &amp; Agents of which have never had any ſuch ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full engine to draw many well affected fouls to them, as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our want of the exerciſe of this power in our Congregations. therefore after their ſundry humble Petitions and Solicitations for the ſetling of this due Power by the Authority of Parliament; They ſaw no other way left them to beare ſufficient and full wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the truth, then by keeping themſelves from acting in ſuch a Government as would be ſo unſutable to Chriſts will, to the end of Government, and the expectation of the World after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profeſſions, and ſuch a Covenant of Reformation. And being neceſſicated to reſolve thus (in caſe &amp;c.) they could doe no leſſe then acquaint the Honourable Houſes therewith, that ſo none might ſay hereafter, that had they declared ſo much in time they might have obtained their defires. And herein, ſo many as wholly condemn not their deſires, I ſuppoſe, will not think them ſo farre miſtaken in their reſolution or the expreſſion of it, as you ſee me to doe.</p>
            <p>Two words more with you, and I have done. You ſay, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darata

I meane, how agrees this <hi>Item</hi> with your arguing upon your <hi>Quaere's?</hi> For if you have ſaid right, (ſpecially on your ſecond, third, and fourth <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re's</hi>) there ought to be no <hi>Moderation,</hi> but a rotall <hi>Abolition</hi> of all Eccleſiaſticall Bower both of ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, and of Excommunication too: If I underſtand you, your arguments confute all, or none. For, I beſeech you, which of all your cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or proofes admit of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and not of <hi>Suſpenſion?</hi> Or which admits of excluding for <hi>any one ſcandall,</hi> how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which doth not for <hi>all ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or how will you anſwer any one of your owne arguments a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall unlimited power,</hi> if it be urged againſt you, even for the <hi>ſeven ſcandals already voted against?</hi> (Inceſt, for inſtance, or Murder, or Blaſphemy?) And what roome then for <hi>adviſe of moderation</hi> among ſuch arguments? But ſhall I tell you my heart concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that motion you make in thoſe words, and the argument couched in them? And it is among the deepeſt thoughts I have, concerning this Matter and this Age. Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> (whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. concerning <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> have been to Admiration, and neare to Propheticall) makes <hi>England,</hi> as you know, the Anti-type of the latter: Surely whoever thinks he is at all in the right therein, and withall have ſeene that luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme Angell ſo ſtrangely ſpewed out, almoſt to the deſtruction of the whole State, (through the difficultie of it joyned to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,) ought to take ſpeciall heed, that they themſelves degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate not into like luke-warmneſſe; which if you can ſhew mee how it can be avoyded under ſuch a <hi>limited Presbyterie,</hi> as ſhall have no power to cenſure <hi>all</hi> ſcandals, <hi>Eris mihi magnus Apollo,</hi> you ſhall be next an Oracle to me. Mean time I only add, that, though I will yeeld to no man (no not to your ſelfe) in my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiall regard to the Honourable Houſes of Parliament; yet, I ſay, that it can be neither the Authoritie of Man, nor the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Eſteem of their Wiſdom or Pietie, that can <hi>ſatisie Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> in any other <hi>Boundarie</hi> than the Word of God ſets, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Scandall and Prophaneneſſe in People (and Miniſters too) and Tyranny and Oppreſſion of mens Conſciences in the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytetie. And, if I had leaſure to look over ſome books, that you have been acquainted with in the Prelaticall times, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:158733:15"/>I could ſhew you like Aſſertions to this in other caſes.</p>
            <p>My Hopes and Prayers are with God, That hee will make the Parliament Honourable and Happie (above all other things) in this great work for his Glorie, his Sons Kingdome, and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Soules and Comforts. And my ſpeciall conſolation is in that Propheticall Sentence, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33. <hi>The LORD is our Iudge, the LORD is our Law-give, the LORD it our King, Hee will ſave us.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>

            <head>A Poſtſcript concerning a ſecond Edition of theſe foure Queſtions.</head>
            <p>VVHen I had well nigh finiſhed this Anſwer to your foure Queſtions, with the Preface and Concluſion, I was ſhewed a ſecond Edition, with ſome alterations. I wondred in many reſpects at the former, but in ſome, much more at this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: Of which I ſhall now give you a briefe account, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor our Readers may complaine of mee, as careleſſe or injurious.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you have now Engliſhed your Quotations of <hi>Aretius</hi> in your Preface, and firſt queſtion, which while it ſtood in Latine, I over-lookt in my Anſwer. But now I muſt needs take a little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. As for his firſt ſentence, may it not be true of all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, even of civill authoritie? Yet he ſhould (juſtly) incur your blame, that would uſe ſuch language to blaſt any lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie (and if this Ecclefiaſticall pleaded for be not lawfull, no danger of a buſe muſt limit it, but the intrinſecall evill of it, muſt reject it altogether,) 2. Next, your Author himſelfe ſeemes to wiſh it, while he would not have men <hi>despaire of reſtoring it.</hi> If it be ſo dangerous or evill, as ſome would make it, it is the object of Feare and Hatred, not of Deſire or Deſpaire. 3. Hee layes the blame on mens manners, that will not ſubmit to ſuch a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. This commends the Diſcipline, though it blame the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of it. When <hi>David</hi> ſhould have puniſht <hi>Joabs</hi> murther of <hi>Abner,</hi> he ſaith the ſons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> were too hard for him. This commends juſtice, though it could not then be executed. 4. As for his laſt clauſe, you were (it ſeemes) willing to make your Readers merrie in theſe ſad times; and yet (I doubt) his double
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:158733:15"/>metaphor of <hi>Mus</hi> and <hi>Spongia</hi> joyned together, will mar the mirth of moſt that look on it, unleſſe they be ſo wiſe as to laugh at they know not what. 5. But were <hi>Aretius</hi> never ſo fully yours in all the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which he is not) though I deſpiſe him not, yet hee cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh, nor counter-ballance <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> and others that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten clearly and ſtrongly for us. Muchleſſe is he to be oppoſed to all the Reformed Churches, who are ſo abundantly knowne to have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcores of yeares practiſed, what we are now labouring for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, next I find you have inſerted ſome words in divers paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which ſo far as I underſtand them, do exceedingly alter the ſenſe, and the ſtate of your Queſtions. As firſt in your ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, after theſe words, <hi>Not actually excommunicated for ſome notorious ſcandall upon a legall conviction;</hi> you add, <hi>Or judicially accuſed, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente lite.</hi> Secondly, afterward Queſt. 4. after the words, <hi>Not actually excommunicated,</hi> you add again, <hi>Or judicially accuſed of ſome groſſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, Pendente lite.</hi> And thirdly in your concluſion, whereas before you ſaid, <hi>Not actually excommunicated;</hi> now you ſay <hi>Not actually, or preparatorily, excommunicated.</hi> What do you, or can you meane by this, which deſtroyes what the reſt of your paper builds, or builds what that deſtroyes. Do you not, to any Readers underſtanding, ſeeme, <hi>not to argue againſt keeping ſuch from the Sacrament, who are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially accuſed, Pendente lite.</hi> And is not this to <hi>grant ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, before excommunication?</hi> Let but us obtaine this power, with relation to <hi>all</hi> ſcandals, to keep away ſuch as are <hi>judicially accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Pendente lite,</hi> and we will promiſe you to ask no more. Have you not then with this daſh of your pen yeelded us our whole cauſe? and been a <hi>Spongia,</hi> to cenſure your paper, <hi>unâ litur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>?</hi> Againe, What is to be <hi>preparatorily excommunicated,</hi> but <hi>ſuſpended?</hi> You pretend not to argue againſt that: We deſired no more. Shall wee be friends then? And will you be entertained of our Counſell, to plead our Cauſe, ſo far as theſe new inſerted phraſes will beare? If ſo, I ſhall love a ſecond Edition, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) the better as long as I live. Fourthly, you interpoſe theſe words neere the end of pag. 3. [<hi>Everie Christian hath a right to the Sacrament,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27.] I anſwer: An <hi>Originall Right,</hi> no man denies; as everie free-borne ſubject hath a right to go abroad to the market or elſewhere, without reſtraint; and ſue for debts, and challenge the protection of the Laws: But you will not ſay, but he may forfeit this right for a time, he may
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:158733:16"/>deſerve to be baniſht, outlawed, impriſoned; and impriſoned for ſome accuſations, even upon ſuſpition. In like ſort may a man forſeit his right to the Sacrament for a time, ſo as to be baniſht (excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated) or reſtrained of this ſpirituall libertie, by ſuſpenſion, which if in ſome caſes it may not be, even for ſuſpition, yet at leaſt upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable proofes of ſcandalous practices. Neither do the Text you cite gain-ſay this. For though <hi>all the Iſraelites,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. are ſaid to <hi>eat of the ſame ſpirituall meat, and to drink of the ſame ſpirituall drink;</hi> yet this was not quâ <hi>ſpirituall meat or drink,</hi> not as Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall food; but a they had no <hi>other at all</hi> to eat or drink. The other verſes ſpeak only of the joynt participation of Chriſtians, which is not denyed ordinatily. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.27. though it ſayes, <hi>Drink yee all of this,</hi> yet it ſaith ſo to none, but thoſe that <hi>were not convicted</hi> of any ſcandall, even <hi>Iudas</hi> was not proved (nor ſo much as openly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) Trayrour or Devill; but the Diſciples at the Supper ſay, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> no man points at him, and ſaith, Lord, is it he? Therefore neither that ſpeech <hi>Drinke yee all of it,</hi> (not <hi>Iudas</hi> his admiſſion, as was roucht before) declares all Chriſtions to have ſuch a right to the Sacrament, as that they cannot fall from it, no not for a time. But notwithſtanding, they have often been admitted, they may appeare ſo unworthy, by ſcandall and impenitence, as that they cannot for the preſent claim that right; and it is for his own good alſo, that he cannot claime it, as a man in a diſtraction, or violent ſeaver, cannot claime the uſe of thoſe things that would undoubtedly do him miſchief but may be kept from them, even from meat &amp; drink, by thoſe that are about him, ſpecially by thoſe that have any power over him. Finally, you have ſome marginals, the firſt is <hi>Q</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 2. unto the words of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>With ſuch an one no not to eat.</hi> Your Margent ſaith, <hi>not meant of eating the Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer. Not properly thoſe words at firſt, for the Apoſtle makes his ſentence an argument <hi>à minori ad majus:</hi> you muſt put away wicked perſons out of the Church, becauſe with ſuch you muſt not ſo much as eat, willingly, at an ordinary ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if you can avoyd it. It is granted then that it is meant in familiar civill converſation (ſo that you might have ſpared all your conſequent Texts, which yet would hardly prove interpretations of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſome of them, if it were needfull to ſpeak to them particularly.) But I pray, offer but to analize the Apoſtles Diſcourſe there, and make him ſpeak ſenſe in bringing in theſe words, while he was urging them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:158733:16"/>to put away the inceſtuous Corinthian (and ſo making a rule for other ſcandalous ſinners.) To what purpoſe ſaith he, <hi>No, not to eat?</hi> but that more is meant; you muſt not ſo much as eat with him at home, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much leſſe allow him to eat with you in the Congregation.</p>
            <p>Your ſecond Note is to prove <hi>Iudas</hi> was at the Sacrament: I have granted it; and ſo am contented to ſay no more of it: except in thanks for your proofes, to requite you with the Anſwer of your Objection hence (and prevention of ſome other) a little more fully then before, in the words of the French Catechiſm, which follow.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>A. As for Baptiſm, becauſe now adayes it is only adminiſtred to Infants, there is no room for any making a difference. But in the Lords Supper the Miniſter ought to take heed that he give it to none who appeares openly to be unworthy.</p>
                        <p>Q. <hi>Why ſo?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. Becauſe it cannot bee done without reproaching and profaning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                        <p>Q. <hi>But did not Chriſt vonchſafe to Iudas, though he was a wicked man, the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of it?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. I acknowledge it, while as yet his impiety was concealed. For though it was not hidden from Chriſt, yet it had not broken out as yet into the light and knowledge of men.</p>
                        <p>Q. <hi>What muſt be done then to Hypocrites?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. The Paſtor cannot put them away as unworthy, but muſt let them alone, untill ſuch time as God reveale their wickedneſſe, that it may be known to men.</p>
                        <p>Q. <hi>What if the Miniſter himſelfe know any man to be unworthy, or any hath admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him of it?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. Even this will not ſuffice to put him from the Communion, unleſſe hereunto be added a legall cognizance and judgement of the Church upon it.</p>
                        <p>Q. <hi>It is requiſite then to have a certaine ſetled order of Government in the Church?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A. It is ſo. For otherwiſe they are not well managed or rightly regulated. Therefore this is the order, that Elders be appointed, who are to cenſure mens manners, and watch over the ſcandals that may ariſe, and to debarrt ſuch from the Sacrament as they know to be unworthy, and who cannot be admitted without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God, and ſcandall to the Faithfull.</p>
